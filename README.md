🏡 House Price Range Prediction using Decision Tree
📌 Project Overview

This project predicts the house price category (Low / Medium / High) based on features such as:

Size (m²) – area of the house

Bedrooms – number of bedrooms

Location Score – quality score of the location

The model uses a Decision Tree Classifier to classify houses into price categories and provides insights such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and feature importance.
